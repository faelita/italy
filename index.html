              Hello! Welcome to my blog, my name is Isabela Meza and I'm 19
              years old, I'm from the city of Santa Marta and I'm currently in
              my fourth semester of children pedagogy. I like to do sports, I
              skated for 12 years until I started college, now I just lift
              weights at the gym. I chose Italy because it is a country that
              has always interested me, I would like to learn the language and
              travel there someday.

                  To confirm the veracity of the stereotypes raised above I did some research, first of all, on gender
                  stereotypes I found a research about it, according to Marmol A. (2017) his studies indicate that Italy
                  is still a country that presents high rates of gender discrimination and that many sexist behaviors
                  still persist, as well as demeaning attitudes towards women. Although in the last century women have
                  made numerous achievements, especially in democratic Western countries, real equality of opportunity
                  between genders is still far away: women, who actually represent half of the world's population, are
                  still highly underrepresented in many fields, politics being one of the most visible examples.

              <div class="col-lg-6" data-aos="fade-up">

                <p class="text-black-50">
                  Secondly, speaking of religion, the publishing house Etecé (2018) states that the predominant religion
                  in Italy is Catholicism, however, its inhabitants also profess other religions such as Protestantism,
                  Judaism and Islam.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div class="col-lg-6" data-aos="fade-up">

                <p class="text-black-50">
                  And finally, according to Santa Cangelo (2022) regarding the use of hands and gestures while speaking,
                  in Italy it is very common to gesture with your hands while speaking, even if you are having a
                  telephone conversation in which the receiver is not able to appreciate your non-verbal language. This
                  is why Italian is known as "the language spoken with the hands".

            Regarding the brainstorming process on stereotypes, it was quite simple because they were the stereotypes I
            had as a child, there are still some that I maintain, however, I do not generalize or think that all
            Italians
            are that way. And for the choice of the 3, I kept the ones I considered to be the easiest to research, I
            mean,
            I don't think a serious website would confirm if Italians eat a lot of pasta. To find out if the stereotypes
            were true or not, I searched for research, reliable websites, I read if the topic the website was about was
            useful to me and from whom the information came from. It is important that we do not stick to a single
            story,
            we do not stick to stereotypes, we can investigate whether they are true or not, we can broaden our view of
            others and not just stick to what we have been told.

              According to Lewis' model, both Italy and Colombia are part of the Multi - active, Multi - active people
              are people - oriented, lots of body language, goes for all-embracing solutions, speech for opinions and
              more. Despite being part of the same category, I would say that if an Italian comes to study in
              Barranquilla could have certain difficulties, some of these are: Firstly, the language, even if the person
              knows Spanish, the people from the coast usually speak very fast, skip some parts of the words and have
              words that are only heard here, making it difficult to understand that person coming from Italy. Secondly,
              if it is a person who drives a car, in Italy the driver is on the right, while here the driver is on the
              left, so they could have problems when driving, it could even cause an accident. Finally, I would say that
              they would have difficulties getting used to the food, especially if they go to a restaurant to eat pasta
              or pizza.

                Non-verbal communication
              </h2>
              <p class="mb-5">
                It had never occurred to me that non-verbal communication could vary depending on the country, as a
                first example, in Italy they have a popularly known gesture, "la pigna" is the most typical Italian
                cliché. It is used to accompany a question or to indicate a doubt. In Colombia this gesture is not seen
                in many people, in fact, if someone uses it is because he is imitating an Italian.
                As a second example, in Italy if you want to say that something is very tasty (in this case talking
                about food), point your index finger against your cheek and rotate it on itself several times. In
                Colombia this is not seen, it is the first time I hear it.
                And as a last example, in Italy to express that you can't stand someone place your hand in front of your
                chest in a vertical position with your fingers extended downwards. Give a couple or three blows on the
                sternum making an exasperated face.
                With these examples we can see that non-verbal communication can vary depending on the country we are
                in, being that both a pro and a con for communication as it can favor us or make us pass a
                misunderstanding.

              The country I chose was Italy, I learned a lot about it, I was able to get rid of stereotypes I had, and
              now I have a deeper look at the country. Certain ideas changed, for example, stereotypes, I knew that
              Italians moved their hands a lot, but I did not know how important these gestures were.
              The thing that surprised me most about the country was one of the stereotypes about gender discrimination,
              I thought there was equality almost in its entirety, but I didn't think the gap was so big. Although women
              over the past century have made many achievements especially in democratic western countries, real
              equality of opportunity between genders is still a long way off.
              What I liked most about the creation of the blog was the iceberg, I guess it was because I made a drawing
              to represent it and because I could really learn the distribution of an iceberg. Also, the information
              from this blog can be useful to me if I move to a foreign culture because I learned that we should not
              stereotype or underestimate others, no matter how much we think it is harmless, on the other hand, the
              information of communication is very important because it is something that can be appreciated a lot in
              Italy, so knowing these gestures can help a lot with our communication in such a country.
              To conclude, doing this blog expanded my way of thinking about another country, Italy. I chose it in the
              beginning because I have always been interested in the language and I would like to travel there at some
              point, hopefully that dream will come true.
